Hi! The state of this code does not reflect how I code at the moment. I'm always improving my knowledge and old repos may reflect old/wrong behavior of coding.

# INFO-19

INFO-19 is a WhatsApp bot created to fight censorship caused by the Brazilian government in hiding total deaths by COVID-19 from the population. With this bot and using brasil.io API, I was able to fetch all the data through a simple message on WhatsApp.

## Installation and use

Use `npm i`;

Use `npm start`, fetch the QRCode and you are ready to go.


## Techs

NodeJS and whatsapp-web.js

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

**A lot of refactor is needed in this app but I did not had the time yet, very busy with others side projects and with Philips itself.**
I may do it in a few days.

A few files were written on the rush to release this project faster(it took me 3 days to release the first version) since COVID-19 were hurting so much brazilian ppl so feel free to suggest something.
