# INFO-19

INFO-19 is a WhatsApp bot created to fight censorship caused by the Brazilian government in hiding total deaths by COVID-19 from the population. With this bot and using brasil.io API, I was able to fetch all the data through a simple message on WhatsApp.

## Installation and use

Use `npm i`;

Use `npm start`, fetch the QRCode and you are ready to go.

Do you wanna test? At the moment the bot is online and working, just add to your whatsapp this number: 81 98165-4534 if you are from Brazil and +55 81 98165-4534 if you are outside Brazil.

## Techs

NodeJS and whatsapp-web.js
